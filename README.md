### Some Fun Facts about me:

:zap: I've founded a few companies in the past. I love playing video games which you'll find over on my [Twitch Channel](http://twitch.tv/MishManners). On my channel, I also do live coding! I'm super into sports, including lots of outdoors adventures like hiking, snowboarding, and wakeboarding. You'll probably run into me at an event, but for now, follow me online and jump in on my Twitch chats!

## GitHub Stats

If you haven't had a chance to check out [GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) yet, do it now. It's a 3D visualisation of your contribution graph. You can view the graphic, make a video, download the STL file, and even view it in Virtual Reality. You can also view the ASCII file and if you know the code combination, you can view the Konami code (コナミコマンド).

As for the pie graph 🥧, if you like my A+ stats, then you can make your own by checking out the [GitHub Readme Stats Repo](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).
